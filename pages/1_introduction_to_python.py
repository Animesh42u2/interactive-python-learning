# The History of Python
st.markdown("## üìú The History of Python")
st.markdown("""
Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s and released in **1991**.

- Guido wanted to design a language that prioritized **code readability** and allowed programmers to express concepts with fewer lines of code.
- The name **Python** doesn‚Äôt come from the snake! It was inspired by Guido‚Äôs love for the comedy series *Monty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus*.

# Key Milestones
st.markdown("## üìÖ Key Milestones in Python‚Äôs Evolution:")
st.markdown("""
1. **1991**: Python 1.0 was released with basic features like functions, modules, and exceptions.
2. **2000**: Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions and garbage collection.
3. **2008**: Python 3.0 marked a major milestone with improvements but was **not backward-compatible**.
4. **2021**: Python 2 officially retired, solidifying Python 3 as the standard version.

**Fun Fact**: Python was named after a TV show, *Monty Python*, not the snake! ‚ôªÔ∏è
