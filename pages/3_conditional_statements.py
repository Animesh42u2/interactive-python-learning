Conditional statements allow us to perform different actions based on conditions.  
In Python, we primarily use `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

Conditional statements evaluate a condition (a boolean expression) and execute specific code blocks based on whether the condition is `True` or `False`.  
They are essential for decision-making in programs. The structure is as follows:
